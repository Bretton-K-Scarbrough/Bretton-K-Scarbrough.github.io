The Fourier transform is an integral transformation that takes an input function and returns the superposition of sines and cosines that makeup the original function.

$$
\mathcal{F}\{f(x)\} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{f(x)e^{-jkx}}dx
$$

This transformation is one of the fundamental building blocks of modern signal analysis.
